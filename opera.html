        <h3>Rudigore</h3>
        <h5>Act II Scene: Picture Gallery in Ruddigore Castle.  The walls are
       covered with full-length portraits of the Baronets of
       Ruddigore from the time of James I.—the first being that of
       Sir Rupert, alluded to in the legend; the last, that of the
       last deceased Baronet, Sir Roderic.</h5>
       <p class="direction">Enter Robin and Adam melodramatically.  They are greatly altered
       in appearance, Robin wearing the haggard aspect of a guilty
       roue; Adam, that of the wicked steward to such a man.</p>

                         DUET—ROBIN and ADAM.

  <h5><p class="rob"></p>ROB.</h5>           <p class="speech">I once was as meek as a new-born lamb,
                      I'm now Sir Murgatroyd—ha! ha!
                           With greater precision</p>
                           <p class="direction">(Without the elision)</p>,
                      Sir Ruthven Murgatroyd—ha! ha!

  <h5><p class="adam"></p>ADAM.</h5>          <p class="song">And I, who was once his valley-de-sham,
                      As steward I'm now employed—ha! ha!
                           The dickens may take him—
                           I'll never forsake him!
                      As steward I'm now employed—ha! ha!

                            ADDITIONAL SONG</p>
                     <p class="direction">(Omitted after opening night.)</p>

  <h5><p class="rob"></p>ROB. </h5>   <p>My face is the index to my mind,
            All venom and spleen and gall—ha! ha!
            Or, properly speaking,
            It soon will be reeking,
            With venom and spleen and gall—ha! ha!</p>

  <h5><p class="adam"></p>ADAM.</h5>  <p>My name from Adam Goodheart you'll find
            I've changed to Gideon Crawle—ha! ha!
            For bad Bart's steward
            Whose heart is much too hard
            Is always Gideon Crawle—ha! ha!</p>

  <h5> <p class=".both"></p>BOTH.</h5>    <p>How dreadful when an innocent heart
            Becomes, perforce, a bad young Bart.,
            And still more hard on old Adam,
            His former faithful valley-de-sham!
</p>
  <h5><p class="rob"></p>ROB. </h5>    <p>This is a painful state of things, old Adam!</p>

    <h5><p class="adam"></p>ADAM.</h5>    <p>Painful, indeed!  Ah, my poor master, when I swore
  that, come what would, I would serve you in all things for ever,
  I little thought to what a pass it would bring me!  The
  confidential adviser to the greatest villain unhung!  Now, sir,
  to business.  What crime do you propose to commit to-day?</p>
